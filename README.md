# CupidJam

As part of a game jam, renamed Cupid's Jam, organized by the Game Devs at Mac student organization in my college, we created a game from scratch on a Valentine's Day / romance theme. 

Our game _A Squirrel's Tail_ (tail, tale get it? ;)), used pygame to create a platform game where one squirrel is at the bottom of the screen and needs to jump on the wooden platforms to reach its lover at the top without falling.

We had 48H to complete the game from scratch, therefore, here are some modifications I would add if I had more time:
- Have the play screen the same size as the Main Menu screen to make it an almost full screen game
- Improve the accuracy of the collision between squirrel and platform
- Use the up or space keys to jump rather than having the squirrel consistently jump up and down
- Adding more sound effects for when the squarrel jumps or when the user loses
- Add levels of difficulties (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 etc)
- Collect hearts equivalent to points on the hard to reach platforms
- Add a cursor, a pause, quit, restart and menu button to the Game window
